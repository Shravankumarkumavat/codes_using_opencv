Overview
Welcome to the Codes_using_opencv Repository! ü§ñüëÅÔ∏è In this repository, we explore various computer vision concepts using the powerful OpenCV library. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an experienced developer, you‚Äôll find something valuable here.
Originally i written this codes for learning about computer vision concepts and how to implement them using opencv. 

what is opencv ?

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful open-source software library designed for computer vision and machine learning tasks. It provides over 2500 optimized algorithms, covering a wide range of applications such as face detection, object recognition, image enhancement, 3D modeling, and augmented reality. OpenCV supports multiple programming languages (including C++, Python, Java, and MATLAB) and runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Android, and macOS). Its active community and widespread adoption make it a go-to resource for both research and industry projects


Like how i have learned little much about opencv, the beginners can also learn for this, i hope this would be helpful for you
